# My Values

Every day we make decisions. Some of them are trivial and there is already a solution, or picking any of them doesn't have a huge cost. For more complex scenarios, it is useful to have a framework; a way to look at problems and to find good solutions.

This is my personal framework. It is a work in progress and by no means it is complete nor correct, however these pillars help me when things get complicated.

- **Sustainable**
    If I am ever settling down over something I want to make sure I can do it for a long period of time. I try to answer _What will be the impact in my health, attention, relationships and on the planet?_

    For example, I've been vegetarian since 2012, and every time I do a purchase I look for alternatives that are carbon-neutral and/or have a positive impact in their communities.

- **Agile**
    When there may be value in multiple things to do, I want to focus on the one that delivers most value. I try to answer _Do I really need to do this?_, in an effort of deferring work until it is evident that I have to do it.

    This value is mostly associated with coding by delivering the less amount of code that is both readable and complete, but also for chores where I do the important ones and put a calendar reminder for the rest.

- **Stoicism**
    When things happens, I want to make sure I focus only in the things that are actually under my control. I try to answer _Given this happened, is there anything I can do to make it better?_
    
    This is by far the most difficult value to apply, although it provides a feeling of freedom when I realize I am actually in control of what happens to me. This also helps me assume full responsibility for everything that happens in my life.

- **Excellence**
    Once I know I have to do something, I aim to do it the best I can. I try to answer _How can I do things better than yesterday?_

    This is particularly useful in my profession and in my habits. The power of compounding small improvements it is hard to grasp until you actually experience it. As they say in Amazon, "Insist on the Highest Standards".
