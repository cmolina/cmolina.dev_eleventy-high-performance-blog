I engage with development teams and organizations to help them deliver their products and services in time, with quality, accessibility, and maintainability in mind.

I am available for consulting in any of my specialties:
- JavaScript and TypeScript applications (NodeJS, React, Angular and vanilla JS)
- Accessibility (talks and workshops, manual and automated testing)
- Code testing (test driven development, automated testing, refactoring legacy code)
- prototyping with code

I speak English and Spanish, and currently I am available within UTC -3 or UTC -4, depending on the time of the year. [Look at my current timezone here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/chile/valparaiso).

If you would like to hire me for one of the above specialties, email me at `hi@cmolina.dev` and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as I can.
