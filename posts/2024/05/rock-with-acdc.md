Welcome to the world of AC/DC, where coding meets rock 'n' roll! No, weâ€™re not talking about shredding guitars or belting out high notes. This <abbr title="Acceptance Criteria Designed Coding">AC/DC</abbr> stands for _Acceptance Criteria Designed Coding_, a new technique Iâ€™ve been crafting for the past few years. Itâ€™s a nod to the legendary band, and a cheeky jab at [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html) fans. Buckle up and get ready to rock your coding workflow!


## The Power Chords of AC/DC

Letâ€™s break down the process and get you rocking.

1. **Grab an Acceptance Criteria (AC) from a Story**

2. **List all its cases**. Create a playlist of _scenarios_. Make sure you keep this list up-to-date as you learn and discover new edge cases

3. **Pick a case, and write it in code following these rules:**
   - **Design the ideal signature**. Make sure to use the same language of the AC
   - **Asserting _behavior_, never _implementation_**: Weâ€™re here to rock the stage, not worry about the backstage setup
   - Use **Arrange, Act, Assert**: Your three-step dance routine.

4. **Make sure the new ACâ€™s case is failing:** If itâ€™s not failing, itâ€™s not rocking hard enough.

5. **Write the minimum amount of code** to make the ACâ€™s case pass: Think minimalistic, like a raw guitar riff.

6. **Optional refactor:** Clean up your code and make it smooth.

7. **Confirm all AC's cases are passing:** Like hitting are the right notes!

8. **If there are still cases unimplement, go back to step 3**. There is more rocking to do

6. **Next AC, Please:** Once youâ€™re done, grab the next AC from the story and start over. It is time for a new hit

## Why Use AC/DC?
Following AC/DC ensures you address all the ACs from a story. If they ever break, youâ€™ll be notified immediately â€“ no more surprise bugs halfway through your concert. This technique has allowed me to move fast in projects while maintaining high code quality.

# Let's Rock an Example

Letâ€™s say weâ€™re grabbing a story for calculating the total price of items in a cart, including tax, in a JavaScript app. Hereâ€™s how weâ€™d rock this with AC/DC.

## Step-by-Step

1. Grab an AC from a story: Calculate the total price of items in a cart, including a fixed tax rate of 10%.

2. List all its cases:
    - An empty cart should return 0
    - A cart with one item of price 100 should return 110 (including tax)
    - A cart with multiple items should sum up all prices and add tax

3. Pick a case: Letâ€™s start with an empty cart.

<div class="code-filename">calculateTotalPrice.test.js</div>

``` javascript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { calculateTotalPrice } from './calculateTotalPrice';

it('should return 0 for an empty cart', () => {
  // Arrange
  const cart = [];

  // Act
  const result = calculateTotalPrice(cart);

  // Assert
  expect(result).toBe(0);
});
```

4. Make sure the new ACâ€™s case is failing: Run the test to see it fail.

``` bash
vitest run
```

5. Write the minimum amount of code to make the ACâ€™s case pass:

<div class="code-filename">calculateTotalPrice.test.js</div>

``` javascript
export function calculateTotalPrice(cart) {
  return 0; // minimum code to pass the test
}
```

6. Optionally refactor: No need yet.

7. Confirm all ACâ€™s cases are passing: Run the test again.

``` bash
vitest run
```

8. If there are still cases unimplemented, go back to step 3: Next case!
<div class="code-filename">calculateTotalPrice.test.js</div>

``` javascript
it('should return 110 for a cart with one item priced at 100', () => {
  const cart = [{ price: 100 }];

  const result = calculateTotalPrice(cart);

  expect(result).toBe(110);
});
```

Run the test to see it fail, then write the minimal code:

<div class="code-filename">calculateTotalPrice.js</div>

``` javascript
export function calculateTotalPrice(cart) {
  if (cart.length === 0) return 0;
  return cart[0].price * 1.1; // minimal code to pass the second test
}
```

Once you write the last case, you may end up with a function like this:

<div class="code-filename">calculateTotalPrice.js</div>

``` javascript
export function calculateTotalPrice(cart) {
  if (cart.length === 0) return 0;
  const total = cart.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
  return total * 1.1;
}
```

6. Optional refactor. We can replace the 1.1 _magic number_ into a well-named constant:

<div class="code-filename">calculateTotalPrice.js</div>

``` javascript
const TAX_RATE = 1.1;

export function calculateTotalPrice(cart) {
  if (cart.length === 0) return 0;
  const total = cart.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
  return total * TAX_RATE;
}
```

7. Confirm all tests are passing, and move on to the next AC with step 9.

# Why AC/DC Rocks

Following AC/DC ensures you cover all the acceptance criteria in a user story, providing a safety net that alerts you if any criteria ever break. This technique lets you move fast in projects while maintaining stellar code quality. Itâ€™s like having your own coding concert where every function hits the perfect note.

So, turn up the volume on your coding skills and give AC/DC a spin. You might just find yourself rocking out more efficient, reliable, and downright awesome code. Rock on! ðŸŽ¸
